# 📝 Website Portfolio

This website is be my final project for my Digital Product Management class. I have been able to learn a ton about HTML and CSS through this class thanks to our weekly assignments and lectures in class. I did not really know what to expect when I signed up for this class, but I am glad I decided to take it becuase I have been able to advance my technological skill level. If you visit my portfolio, you will be able to learn a little bit about me and what my interests are.
