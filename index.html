        <img src="./images/Headshot.jpeg" width="400" height="500" alt="Image Unavailable">
        <p> Hello! My name is Ben Sheridan and I am currently a senior at the University of Iowa studying Business Analytics and Sports and Recreation Management. I am also a student basketball manager here at Iowa, so that takes up a lot of my time. In my free time though, I like hanging out with friends, watching sports, and listening to music!</p>
        <p> My top listened to Artists on Spotify (2022): </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Drake</li>
            <li>Youngboy</li>
            <li>Morgan Wallen</li>
            <li>21 Savage</li>
            <li>Gunna</li>
        </ol>

        <p> My friends and I love to watch our favorite teams sports together. In the table below, I displayed lists of our favorite teams in order:</p>

        <table>
            <tr>
                <td> Ben</td>
                <td> Connor</td>
                <td> Mason</td>
                <td> Michael</td>
            </tr>

            <tr> <td>1. Iowa</td> <td>1. Iowa</td><td>1. Notre Dame</td> <td>1. Iowa</td></tr>
            <tr> <td>2. Cubs</td> <td>2. Vikings</td><td>2. Bears</td> <td>2. Bears</td></tr>
            <tr> <td>3. Sixers</td> <td>3. Cardinals</td><td>3. Dodgers</td> <td>3. Cardinals</td></tr>
            <tr> <td>4. Cowboys</td> <td>4. Warriors</td><td>4. Warriors</td> <td>4. Clippers</td></tr>
        </table>

        <h2>This Basketball Season:</h2>
        <p> I have been fortunate enough to be a student basketball manager the last three years here at Iowa. I have learned a lot from the coaches and players, and want to continue coaching once I graduate. Being a manager is an extremely rewarding experience as the long hours we put in can make for long days, but in the end it is always worth it. The picture displayed below is from a game earlier this year: </p>
