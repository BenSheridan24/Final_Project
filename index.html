        <h1>About Me:</h1>
        <img src="./images/Trophy.png" width="400" height="500" alt="Image Unavailable">
        <p> Hello! My name is Ben Sheridan and I am currently a senior at the University of Iowa studying Business Analytics and Sports and Recreation Management. I am also a student basketball manager here at Iowa, so that takes up a lot of my time. In my free time though, I like hanging out with friends, watching sports, and listening to music!</p>
        <p> My favorite classes I took the last four years in college: </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Coaching Theory</li>
            <li>BAIS Capstone</li>
            <li>Finance in Sport</li>
            <li>Digital Product Management</li>
            <li>Athletic Administration</li>
        </ol>

        <p> My friends and I love to watch our favorite teams sports together. In the table below, I displayed lists of our favorite teams in order:</p>

        <table>
            <tr>
                <td> Ben</td>
                <td> Connor</td>
                <td> Mason</td>
                <td> Pat</td>
            </tr>

            <tr> <td>1. Iowa</td> <td>1. Iowa</td><td>1. Notre Dame</td> <td>1. Iowa</td></tr>
            <tr> <td>2. Cubs</td> <td>2. Vikings</td><td>2. Bears</td> <td>2. Bears</td></tr>
            <tr> <td>3. Sixers</td> <td>3. Cardinals</td><td>3. Dodgers</td> <td>3. Notre Dame</td></tr>
            <tr> <td>4. Cowboys</td> <td>4. Warriors</td><td>4. Warriors</td> <td>4. Kings</td></tr>
        </table>

        <h2>This Basketball Season:</h2>
        <p> I have been fortunate enough to be a student basketball manager the last three years here at Iowa. I have learned a lot from the coaches and players, and want to continue coaching once I graduate. Being a manager is an extremely rewarding experience as the long hours we put in can make for long days, but in the end it is always worth it. Next year, I am going to be a graduate assistant which will be a great opportunity for me to continue to learn the game. The picture displayed below is from a game earlier this year: </p>
